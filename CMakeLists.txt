# as it used to output the linker flag for PCRE2 just as "-lpcre2-8",
# and just above we set the correct -L flag with the path of PCRE2
# cross-compiled for Android. However, with CMake 3.22.1 the CMake's default
# output is "-L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu;-lpcre2-8", which ends up forcing
# Lighttpd to try linking against the host's PCRE2, which fails. The flag set
# below instructs pkg-config to not include -L flag into outputs,
# thus restoring the correct linking. However, it is not the best fix,
# I guess.
